App Core
===========

A set of extensions for Kotlin and RX utilities for more comfortable development of android applications. 
This library is designed to combine often used functions in development and provide 
a convenient API for working with widespread, boilerplate tasks. 
Each project contains an utility package, so this project is called upon to replace it, 
as well as find a quick solution for everyday tasks. 
You can add the library completely or select only the modules you need. 

See [Getting Started](#getting-started) for more information about how to start using this library.

Few samples:
===========
**Date extensions:**

```kotlin
var sampleDate:Date = System.currentTimeMillis().toDate()
var formattedDate = sampleDate
                        .toStringWithFormat(CommonFormats.FORMAT_SIMPLE_DATE_TIME)
```
**Fonts and Spans extensions:**
```kotlin
var spannableText = someStingText.applyFont(context, "Roboto-Bold.ttf")
```
```kotlin
var spannableText = (someStringText.applySpanSet()
                      add font(getTypeface("Roboto-Bold.ttf")) toText "Digital"
                      and font(getTypeface("Roboto-Italic.ttf")) from start2 to end2
                      and relativeSize(1.8f) toText "revolution"
                      and foregroundColor(Color.GREEN) from start3
                      and absSize(28f.spToPx(context).toInt()) toText "we do.").build()
```

**Intents:**
```kotlin
  callIntent("+### ### ## ##").launch(context)
```

```kotlin
 selectContactIntent()
        .launchForResult(context)
        .subscribe(
           { rxResult:RxActivityResult->
                   doSomeThingWithResult(rxResult)
           },
           { 
             it.message.toString.showToast(contxt)
           })
```
